ABANDON HOPE, YE WHO ENTER THIS PLACE
=====================================

The hook(s) in this directory must be placed in the `<root>/.git/hooks` directory of the repository. Anyone sending pull requests without having used these hooks will be automatically rejected.

**NOTE**: You also need to use a Git client that supports hooks such as msysgit, SourceTree, or the command line. GitHub for Windows/Mac does **not** support hooks.

All hooks currently require PHP 5.4.0 or later (as well as the path to the PHP executable being the PATH environment variable).
