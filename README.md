====================

A Google Chrome extension for keeping up to date on the latest alerts and invasions.

Compatibility
=============

Warframe Info Centre (henceforth referred to as WIC) is only compatible with Google Chrome (version 22 or later required), other Chromium-based browsers have not been tested and WIC will likely not even function with them.

Features
========

* [✔] Automatic updating.
* [**x**] Desktop notifications.
* [✔] Alerts support.
* [**x**] Invasions support.
* [**x**] Dark Sector support.
* [✔] Fully configurable.
* [✔] User interface.

Building
========

WIC is primarily written in CoffeeScript, which has to be compiled to JavaScript before the extension can be used. If you would like to build this extension for yourself, you will need to perform a few extra steps.

1. Install Python 3.x from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it already.
2. Install Python's [CoffeeScript](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CoffeeScript/1.0.9) and [PyExecJS](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyExecJS) modules to your Python 3.x installation.
3. Run `build.py` from the command-line to compile all `.coffee` files to `.js` files.
